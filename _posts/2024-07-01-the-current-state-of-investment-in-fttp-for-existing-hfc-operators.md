### The Current State of Investment in FTTP for Existing HFC Operators

As the demand for higher internet speeds and more reliable connectivity continues to grow, many HFC (Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial) operators are increasingly investing in Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) infrastructure. This shift is driven by the need to future-proof their networks and stay competitive in the rapidly evolving telecommunications landscape. The approach and intensity of investment in FTTP vary significantly across different regions, influenced by market dynamics, regulatory environments, and competitive pressures. Here’s a closer look at the current state of investment in FTTP by existing HFC operators in Europe, the US, and other key markets.

### Europe

#### Strategic Investments and Full-Fiber Deployments

In Europe, many HFC operators are making significant investments in FTTP, driven by both regulatory pressures and the competitive landscape.

- **Regulatory Support**: The European Union has set ambitious targets for gigabit connectivity and full-fiber coverage by 2025, which has encouraged operators to accelerate their FTTP deployments.
- **Examples of Investment**:
  - **Liberty Global**: One of the largest HFC operators in Europe, Liberty Global is actively investing in FTTP through its operating companies like Virgin Media in the UK. Virgin Media O2, a joint venture with Telefónica, has committed to reaching millions of premises with FTTP by 2028.
  - **Vodafone**: In countries like Germany, Vodafone is upgrading its HFC networks with FTTP. Through its joint venture with Altice, it plans to reach 7 million homes with FTTP by 2027.

#### Competitive Pressure and Market Consolidation

- **Incumbent Telcos**: Traditional telecom operators like BT (British Telecom) and Deutsche Telekom are also heavily investing in FTTP, creating a competitive environment that pushes HFC operators to follow suit.
- **Market Consolidation**: There is an increasing trend of market consolidation, with operators merging or acquiring smaller ISPs to strengthen their FTTP capabilities and expand their fiber footprint.

### United States

#### Gradual Transition and Targeted Investments

In the US, the approach to FTTP investment among HFC operators is more varied, influenced by market conditions and competitive dynamics.

- **Incremental Upgrades**: Many US HFC operators are taking a more gradual approach, balancing investments between upgrading their existing HFC infrastructure (e.g., with DOCSIS 3.1 and 4.0) and deploying FTTP in targeted areas.
- **Examples of Investment**:
  - **Comcast**: One of the largest HFC operators, Comcast is focusing on extending the life of its HFC networks with DOCSIS 4.0 while also deploying FTTP in greenfield areas (new developments where no existing infrastructure is present).
  - **Charter Communications**: Similar to Comcast, Charter is investing in a combination of DOCSIS upgrades and targeted FTTP deployments, particularly in markets where competitive pressure from FTTP providers like AT&T is high.

#### Government Incentives and Rural Focus

- **Federal Funding**: The US government has allocated substantial funding through programs like the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) to support broadband expansion in underserved areas, encouraging operators to invest in FTTP.
- **Rural Deployments**: HFC operators are increasingly participating in these programs, using the funding to extend FTTP to rural and underserved regions where the ROI for such investments may be more challenging without subsidies.

### Other Key Markets

#### Australia

- **NBN Co**: The National Broadband Network (NBN) project, initially a mix of technologies, is now focusing more on FTTP upgrades of the FTTN and FTTC footprint. Unless federal or state governments provide significant funding for FTTP, it is likely that nbn will overbuild it's existing HFC footprint in a significaint way.

#### Asia

- **Japan and South Korea**: These countries are already leaders in FTTP deployment, with high penetration rates. HFC operators in these markets have largely transitioned to FTTP to meet consumer demand for ultra-fast broadband.
- **China**: The Chinese government’s aggressive push for fiber infrastructure has led to extensive FTTP deployments, with operators like China Telecom and China Mobile investing heavily in expanding their fiber networks.

### Conclusion

The current state of investment in FTTP by existing HFC operators reflects a strategic balancing act. In Europe, regulatory mandates and competitive pressures are driving substantial FTTP investments. In the US, a mix of DOCSIS upgrades and targeted FTTP deployments characterizes the approach, supported by government incentives for rural broadband expansion. Other markets like Australia and parts of Asia are also seeing significant FTTP investments, driven by national broadband policies and consumer demand.

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the trend towards FTTP is likely to accelerate, with HFC operators seeking to future-proof their networks and deliver the high-speed, reliable connectivity that modern consumers and businesses increasingly demand.

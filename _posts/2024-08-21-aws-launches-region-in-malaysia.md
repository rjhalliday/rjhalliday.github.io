### A New Era of Innovation: AWS Launches in Malaysia

It’s been over a decade since I last managed servers in Malaysia, a time when rack-mounted servers were the norm, and I was running a WiFi and paid computer kiosk authentication system based on FreeRadius and MySQL. Back then, I was challenged by the latency to New Zealand and Australia, which caused persistent issues with our setup. Fast forward to today, and the technological landscape in Malaysia has transformed in ways that I could only dream of during those early days.

The recent launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region marks a significant milestone not just for cloud computing in Malaysia but also for innovators like myself who have deep ties to the country. With three Availability Zones and the API name ap-southeast-5, this new region offers unprecedented opportunities for businesses and developers to leverage cutting-edge technology right at their doorstep.

#### A Personal Connection to Malaysia’s Growth

Having spent significant time in Malaysia over the past two decades and with close family ties to the country, this launch feels particularly special to me. I remember the struggles of dealing with latency and the limitations of the traditional server approach, especially when trying to maintain a reliable system that connected to New Zealand. The idea of having access to an AWS Region within Malaysia back then would have been a game-changer, eliminating many of the issues I faced.

Now, with AWS’s infrastructure in place, the possibilities are endless. The proximity of this region will drastically reduce latency and open up new opportunities for innovation, not just for me but for countless others who have experienced similar challenges.

#### Empowering a Nation and Beyond

The AWS Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region is set to play a pivotal role in supporting Malaysia’s Madani Economy Framework, an initiative aiming to elevate the living standards of all Malaysians by 2030. With an estimated $12.1 billion (MYR 57.3 billion) added to Malaysia’s GDP and the creation of over 3,500 full-time equivalent jobs annually through 2038, the impact of this launch goes far beyond just technology. It’s about empowering a nation and fueling innovation across Southeast Asia.

#### A New Frontier for Innovators

For those of us who have been part of Malaysia’s tech journey, the launch of this region is a dream come true. AWS’s presence in Malaysia isn’t new; they’ve been building a solid foundation since 2016, with initiatives like Amazon CloudFront, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS Outposts already making waves in the local tech community. But now, with a fully operational region, the scale and scope of what we can achieve have grown exponentially.

The stories of AWS customers in Malaysia, from PayNet’s national payment workloads to Asia Pacific University’s serverless architecture, are a testament to the transformative power of cloud computing. These success stories are just the beginning. With the new region, the door is wide open for more local innovators to take their ideas to the next level.

#### Building the Future Together

AWS’s commitment to building cloud skills in Malaysia through initiatives like Program AKAR, AWS Academy, and the AWS Skills Guild at PETRONAS ensures that the next generation of builders will have the tools and knowledge they need to thrive in this new digital era. As someone who has navigated the challenges of Malaysia’s tech landscape for years, I’m incredibly excited to see how these programs will shape the future of innovation in the country.

#### A Bright Future Ahead

The launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region is more than just an expansion of infrastructure; it’s a catalyst for innovation, growth, and sustainability. For someone like me, who has seen the evolution of Malaysia’s tech scene firsthand, this moment is both nostalgic and exhilarating. The challenges of the past are now opportunities for the future, and I can’t wait to see what the next decade will bring for Malaysia and the broader Southeast Asian region.
